            <column name="text">When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life.
                When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down ‘happy’.
                They told me I didn’t understand the assignment, and I told them they didn’t understand life.

                We need to learn to love ourselves first, in all our glory and our imperfections.
                If we cannot love ourselves, we cannot fully open to our ability to love others or our potential to create.
                Evolution and all hopes for a better world rest in the fearlessness and open-hearted vision of people who embrace life</column>
